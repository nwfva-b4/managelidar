\title{Compute pulse penetration ratios from LAS headers}
\usage{
get_penetration(path, full.names = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character vector specifying one or more paths to:
\itemize{
\item LAS/LAZ/COPC files
\item Directories containing LAS/LAZ/COPC files (non-recursive)
\item Virtual Point Cloud files (\code{.vpc}) referencing LAS files
}}

\item{full.names}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, return full file paths in the
\code{filename} column. If \code{FALSE} (default), only the base file names
are returned.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with one row per input file and the following columns:
\describe{
\item{filename}{File name or full path of the LAS file}
\item{single}{Proportion of pulses with exactly one return}
\item{two}{Proportion of pulses with exactly two returns}
\item{three}{Proportion of pulses with exactly three returns}
\item{four}{Proportion of pulses with exactly four returns}
\item{five}{Proportion of pulses with exactly five returns}
\item{six}{Proportion of pulses with exactly six returns}
\item{multiple}{Proportion of pulses with two or more returns}
}
}
\description{
\code{get_penetration()} computes approximate pulse penetration ratios for
LAS/LAZ/COPC files using information stored in the LAS file header.
Only header data are read; point data are not loaded.
}
\details{
The function estimates the proportion of pulses that resulted in
exactly one return, two returns, three returns, up to six returns,
as well as the proportion of pulses with multiple returns (two or more).

Pulse penetration ratios are derived from the
\dQuote{Number of points by return} field in the LAS header.
Because only header information is used, results are approximate.

For small files or spatially clipped tiles, pulses may be split at
tile boundaries, which can lead to biased penetration ratios.
Consequently, values should be interpreted as indicative rather than
exact.
