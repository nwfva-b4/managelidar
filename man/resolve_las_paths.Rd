\usage{
resolve_las_paths(paths)
}
\arguments{
\item{paths}{Character vector of file or directory paths, or a list that may
contain VPC objects (lists with \code{type = "FeatureCollection"}).}
}
\value{
A character vector of resolved LAS/LAZ/COPC file paths.
Returns an empty character vector (invisibly) if no valid files
are found.
}
\description{
Resolves a character vector of file system paths or VPC objects into a flat
character vector of LAS/LAZ/COPC file paths. Inputs may be individual files,
directories, \code{.vpc} files, or VPC objects already loaded in R. Unsupported
paths and formats are silently ignored.
}
\details{
This function is intended for internal use. It performs no validation
beyond basic existence checks and never errors or warns.

Supported inputs:
\itemize{
\item Individual \code{.las}, \code{.laz}, or \code{.copc} files
\item Directories (non-recursive search)
\item \code{.vpc} files (assets are extracted from the VPC JSON)
\item VPC objects already loaded in R (lists with \code{type = "FeatureCollection"})
}

Unsupported file formats, non-existent paths, empty directories,
and unreadable \code{.vpc} files are silently skipped.
