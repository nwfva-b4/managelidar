}
\arguments{

}
\details{
This function is intended for internal use. It performs no validation
beyond basic existence checks and never errors or warns.

Supported inputs:
\itemize{
\item Individual \code{.las}, \code{.laz}, or \code{.copc} files
\item Directories (non-recursive search)
\item \code{.vpc} files (assets are extracted from the VPC JSON)
}

Unsupported file formats, non-existent paths, empty directories,
and unreadable \code{.vpc} files are silently skipped.
