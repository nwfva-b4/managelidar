\title{Filter to multi-temporal tiles}
\usage{
filter_multitemporal(path, entire_tiles = TRUE, tolerance = 1, out_file = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character vector of input paths, a VPC file path, or a VPC object
already loaded in R. Can be a mix of LAS/LAZ/COPC files and \code{.vpc} files.}

\item{entire_tiles}{Logical. If TRUE, only considers tiles that are exactly 1000x1000 m
and aligned to a 1000m grid (default: TRUE)}

\item{tolerance}{Numeric. Tolerance in coordinate units for snapping extents to grid
(default: 1, submeter inaccuracies are ignored). If > 0, coordinates within this distance of a grid line will be
snapped before processing. Set to 0 to disable snapping.}

\item{out_file}{Optional. Path where the filtered VPC should be saved.
If NULL (default), returns the VPC as an R object.
If provided, saves to file and returns the file path.
Must have \code{.vpc} extension and must not already exist.
File is only created if filtering returns results.}
}
\value{
If \code{out_file} is NULL, returns a VPC object (list) containing only
tiles with multiple temporal observations. If \code{out_file} is provided and results
exist, returns the path to the saved \code{.vpc} file. Returns NULL invisibly
if no multi-temporal tiles are found.
}
\description{
Identifies and filters tiles that have been observed multiple times
(multi-temporal coverage), returning a VPC with only those tiles.
}
\details{
This function identifies tiles that have been observed multiple times (multi-temporal
coverage). It reads extent and date information from a VPC (Virtual Point Cloud) file,
optionally snaps coordinates to a regular grid, and groups observations by spatial extent.

When \code{entire_tiles = TRUE}, only tiles that are exactly 1000x1000 m and
aligned to a 1000 m grid are included in the analysis.

When \code{tolerance > 0}, coordinates within that distance of a grid line are
snapped to handle minor floating point inaccuracies.
