\title{Filter to multi-temporal tiles}
\usage{
filter_multitemporal(path, entire_tiles = TRUE, tolerance = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character vector of input paths, a VPC file path, or a VPC object
already loaded in R. Can be a mix of LAS/LAZ/COPC files and \code{.vpc} files.}

\item{entire_tiles}{Logical. If TRUE, only considers tiles that are exactly 1000x1000 m
and aligned to a 1000m grid (default: TRUE)}

\item{tolerance}{Numeric. Tolerance in coordinate units for snapping extents to grid
(default: 1, submeter inaccuracies are ignored). If > 0, coordinates within this distance of a grid line will be
snapped before processing. Set to 0 to disable snapping.}
}
\value{
A VPC object (list) containing only tiles with multiple temporal observations.
Returns NULL invisibly if no multi-temporal tiles are found.
}
\description{
Identifies and filters tiles that have been observed multiple times
(multi-temporal coverage), returning a VPC with only those tiles.
}
\details{
This function identifies tiles that have been observed multiple times (multi-temporal
coverage). It reads extent and date information from a VPC (Virtual Point Cloud) file,
optionally snaps coordinates to a regular grid, and groups observations by spatial extent.

When \code{entire_tiles = TRUE}, only tiles that are exactly 1000x1000 m and
aligned to a 1000 m grid are included in the analysis.

When \code{tolerance > 0}, coordinates within that distance of a grid line are
snapped to handle minor floating point inaccuracies.

\strong{Important:} The returned VPC contains \emph{all} observations for multi-temporal
tiles, meaning multiple files may reference the same spatial tile. This is typically
not suitable for direct processing in most workflows in lasR, as data will be processed together.
E.g. creating a Canopy Height Model based on multi-temporal VPCs will result in a single CHM raster based on
lidar data from all acquisitions instead of a separate CHM raster for each acquisition time.

Usually you want to use \code{\link{filter_first}} or \code{\link{filter_latest}} instead.

This intermediate filtering step might be useful when you need to:
\itemize{
\item Identify which tiles have multi-temporal data before selecting a time period
\item Explicitly want to work with combined multi-temporal data
}
}
\examples{
f <- system.file("extdata", package = "managelidar")

# Identify multi-temporal tiles
vpc_multi <- filter_multitemporal(f)


# Or chain filters for specific workflows:
vpc <- f |>
  filter_multitemporal() |>
  filter_temporal("2024") |>
  filter_latest()
