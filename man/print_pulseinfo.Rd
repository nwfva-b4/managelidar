\name{print_pulseinfo}
\alias{print_pulseinfo}
\title{Print summary information about pulse density and penetration ratio}
\usage{
print_pulseinfo(path)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{The path to a LASfile (.las/.laz/.copc), to a directory which contains LASfiles, or to a Virtual Point Cloud (.vpc) referencing LASfiles.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. The function is called for its
side effect of printing to the console.
}
\description{
\code{print_pulseinfo()} computes and prints summary statistics of
LiDAR pulse density, point density, and penetration rates
(single vs. multiple returns).
}
\details{
The function uses \code{\link[=get_density]{get_density()}} to calculate average
pulse and point densities, and \code{\link[=get_penetration]{get_penetration()}} to
compute average penetration rates for single and multiple
returns.

This function is intended for exploratory reporting and prints
aggregated statistics to the console. It does not return values.

folder <- system.file("extdata", package = "managelidar")
