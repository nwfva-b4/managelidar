\title{Filter to latest acquisition from multi-temporal tiles}
\usage{
filter_latest(
  path,
  entire_tiles = TRUE,
  tolerance = 1,
  multitemporal_only = FALSE,
  out_file = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character vector of input paths, a VPC file path, or a VPC object
already loaded in R. Can be a mix of LAS/LAZ/COPC files and \code{.vpc} files.}

\item{entire_tiles}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), only considers tiles where
the entire tile area has multi-temporal coverage. If \code{FALSE}, includes tiles
with partial multi-temporal coverage.}

\item{tolerance}{Numeric. Tolerance in coordinate units for snapping extents to grid
(default: 1, submeter inaccuracies are ignored). If > 0, coordinates within this distance of a grid line will be
snapped before processing. Set to 0 to disable snapping.}

\item{multitemporal_only}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, only returns tiles with multiple
acquisitions. If \code{FALSE} (default), includes all tiles.}

\item{out_file}{Optional. Path where the filtered VPC should be saved.
If NULL (default), returns the VPC as an R object.
If provided, saves to file and returns the file path.
Must have \code{.vpc} extension and must not already exist.
File is only created if filtering returns results.}
}
\value{
If \code{out_file} is NULL, returns a VPC object (list) containing only
the latest acquisition for each tile. If \code{out_file} is provided and results
exist, returns the path to the saved \code{.vpc} file. Returns NULL invisibly
if no features match the filter.
}
\description{
Identifies tiles with multiple acquisitions and returns only the latest (newest)
acquisition for each tile as a filtered VPC.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Resolves input paths to a VPC object
\item Checks for multi-temporal coverage using \code{\link{filter_multitemporal}}
\item Groups tiles by location and selects the latest acquisition for each
\item Returns either a VPC object or writes a filtered VPC file
}
}
\examples{
f <- system.file("extdata", package = "managelidar")
vpc <- filter_latest(f)
