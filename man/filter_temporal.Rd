\title{Filter point cloud files by temporal extent}
\usage{
filter_temporal(path, start, end = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character vector of input paths, a VPC file path, or a VPC object
already loaded in R. Can be a mix of LAS/LAZ/COPC files and \code{.vpc} files.}

\item{start}{POSIXct, Date, or character. Start of temporal range (inclusive).
Character strings are parsed as ISO 8601 datetime (e.g., "2024-03-27" or
"2024-03-27T10:30:00Z"). Can also be year ("2024"), year-month ("2024-03"),
or full date ("2024-03-27").}

\item{end}{POSIXct, Date, or character. End of temporal range (inclusive).
If NULL (default), the end is automatically determined based on the
granularity of \code{start}:
\itemize{
\item Year only ("2024"): end of that year
\item Year-month ("2024-03"): end of that month
\item Full date ("2024-03-27"): end of that day (23:59:59)
\item Full datetime: same as start (exact match)
}}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE (default), prints information about filtering results.}
}
\value{
A VPC object (list) containing only features within the temporal range.
Returns NULL invisibly if no features match the filter.
}

Filter point cloud files by temporal extent

\examples{
folder <- system.file("extdata", package = "managelidar")
las_files <- list.files(folder, full.names = T, pattern = "*.laz")

# Filter by single day (all features from that day)
vpc <- las_files |> filter_temporal("2024-03-27")

# Filter by month (all features from March 2024)
vpc <- las_files |> filter_temporal("2024-03")

# Filter by year (all features from 2024)
vpc <- las_files |> filter_temporal("2024")

# Filter by explicit date range
vpc <- las_files |> filter_temporal("2024-03-01", "2024-03-31")

# Filter by datetime range
vpc <- las_files |> filter_temporal("2024-03-27T00:00:00Z", "2024-03-27T12:00:00Z")

# Using Date objects
vpc <- las_files |> filter_temporal(as.Date("2024-03-27"))
