\title{Filter point cloud files by spatial extent}
\usage{
filter_spatial(path, extent, crs = NULL, out_file = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character vector of input paths, a VPC file path, or a VPC object
already loaded in R. Can be a mix of LAS/LAZ/COPC files and \code{.vpc} files.}

\item{extent}{Spatial extent to filter by. Can be:
\itemize{
\item Numeric vector of length 2 (point: x, y) or 4 (bbox: xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)
\item sf/sfc object (point, multipoint, polygon, bbox)
}}

\item{crs}{Character or numeric. Coordinate reference system of the extent.
If NULL (default) and extent is numeric, assumes extent is in the same CRS
as the VPC features. Required for sf objects without CRS.
Can be EPSG code (e.g., 4326, 25832) or WKT2 string.}

\item{out_file}{Optional. Path where the filtered VPC should be saved.
If NULL (default), returns the VPC as an R object.
If provided, saves to file and returns the file path.
Must have \code{.vpc} extension and must not already exist.
File is only created if filtering returns results.}
}
\value{
If \code{out_file} is NULL, returns a VPC object (list) containing only
features that intersect the extent. If \code{out_file} is provided and results
exist, returns the path to the saved \code{.vpc} file. Returns NULL invisibly
if no features match the filter.
